Smoking status prediction using machine learning techniques

Smoking has been shown to be detrimental to health in many ways. We know that smoking damages almost every organ in the body, causes many diseases, and generally shortens the life expectancy of smokers. It is recognized as a leading cause of mortality and continues to put pressure on global health.

According to a World Health Organization report, the number of deaths from smoking is expected to reach 10 million by 2030.

Evidence-based treatments to support smoking cessation are proposed and promoted. However, less than one-third of his participants achieved their abstinence goals. Many physicians found smoking cessation counseling to be ineffective and time consuming, and did not implement it regularly in their daily practice. To solve this problem, several factors, such as nicotine dependence, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) concentration, number of cigarettes per day, and age at which smoking starts, are used to identify smokers who are more likely to quit. Some factors have been proposed. , previous smoking cessation attempts, marital status, emotional distress, temperament and impulsivity scores, and motivations for quitting. However, using these predictors individually can lead to conflicting results that are not easy for physicians and patients to interpret and apply. Providing predictive models could be an inexpensive way to understand individual smokers' likelihood of quitting. Models for predicting health outcomes have been developed in recent years using machine learning techniques.

A group of scientists are working on predictive models that target smoking status.
